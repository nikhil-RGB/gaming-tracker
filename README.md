# gaming_tracker

This app is designed to log and track your daily gaming habits, providing weekly and daily statistics on
- Hours spent playing certain games.
- Power modes used during a session (Balanced/Performance/Turbo).
- Average fan speed of the Computer's CPU and GPU.
- Fan modes applied during the session(Auto/Custom/Max).

> [!NOTE]  
> This tracker app does not automatically log sessions, and stores all information on the phone's local file system.

## How to Use and Screenshots

<br>

Before logging gaming sessions, any games the user plays and would like to save sessions of should be 'registered' manually.

### Step 1: Register a Game

  <br>
  <br>

- Fill in the name of the game, description and select an image for the game. Note that 'All Games' is an invalid name and duplicate game names are not allowed.
- Once the details have been entered, click on "Save" to save the game.
- Repeat this process for whichever games you wish to track.

  ### Step 2: Logging/Viewing a Session

  <br>

  #### Logging sessions:

  <br>

  - Navigate to the 'Calendar' page by clicking on the calendar icon in the bottom navbar.
  - This page provides an efficient way to select a particular date to log gaming sessions/view playtime data.
  - Once a day has been selected, click on the floating action play button to view the games played on that day/log additional gaming sessions.

- Once the user chooses a game to log, they will be presented with the 'Performance' page, this allows users to enter the number of hours the game was played and also input:
     - Power Modes selected : The user is presented with 3 options: Balanced, Performance and Turbo. This information is generally more applicable to gaming laptop users since performance control softwares geenrally allow the standard user to switch between these three or similar power modes to increase/throttle performance and consequently temperatures. More sophisticated logging of CPU PL1/PL2 power limits, GPU voltage curves, underclocking, overclocking, etc is unfortunately not available in this app.
     -  Fan Modes : The user is presented with 3 options: Auto, Max and Custom. These refer to the default fan curve provided by the manafacturer, the maximum speed the CPU and GPU fans can spin at and a customized static fan speed for the CPU/GPU. Custom fan curves cannot be logged.
     -  Average fan speed: The user can input the average fan speed on the CPU/GPU during the session, or in the case of the Custom fan mode- the actual static speeds.
